# Twinspire
Twinspire is a 2D rendering and application framework written in two different languages.

There are manageable options that exist within Twinspire with ongoing development of a new context system being put in place to support a wider range of applications. The goal of Twinspire is not to be another engine, but rather to supply a set of tools that perform trivial tasks and leaving the rest of the development to the developer.

## Features

The following features in the Core library include:

 1. Application creation
 2. Event handling
 3. Resource management
 4. Some basic, useful utilities

### On-Going Features

 1. Automated Event Simulations for user inputs.
 2. Automated Physics Simulations for any game event loop.
 3. Physics and Maths implementations
 4. Custom scripting support with interoperability between both Haxe and ODIN.

## Installation

### Haxe
You will require `Git` to install Twinspire on your computer. It is recommended to use it in conjunction with Haxelib for easier updating:

    haxelib git twinspire https://github.com/twinspire/Core.git

Alternatively, you can use `git clone` but you will have to setup a `haxelib dev` environment yourself.

### ODIN
It is not currently recommended to use ODIN. It is expected to have better support when the Haxe version is updated.

## How to Use Twinspire
The [WIKI page](https://github.com/twinspire/Core/wiki) contains tutorials and information on how you can get started with using Twinspire.

It is not recommended to use the new context system until it is ready for production purposes. There is currently no documentation for it as of yet.
